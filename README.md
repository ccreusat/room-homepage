## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JS.

### What I learned

- Did a really good job with the CSS Grid to be fully responsive. Tested on many screen sizes: 1280, 1440, larger and smaller.
- Glad to have found a way to handle the slider's arrows with all these overflow:hidden; and they keep the square ratio (1:1);
- JS functions checking Media Queries and the Window Resize work pretty well too.

### Continued development

Still have to work on the drag function to move the slides. Had some issues I still haven't fixed.

### Useful resources

- [About key events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/key) - This helped me to check the key event.
- [About touch events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Touch_events/Using_Touch_Events) - This helped me about the touches events.
- [SleepWalker](https://gist.github.com/SleepWalker/da5636b1abcbaff48c4d) - This helped me about the swipe event.
- [Codepen SliderJS](https://codepen.io/cconceicao/pen/PBQawy) - I'll take a look about the Drag event. Helped me about the cloned slides.
